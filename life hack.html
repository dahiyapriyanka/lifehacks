                <h2>Instant picture frame bumpers</h2>
                <p>stop wall frames from slipping out of place and scratching the wall paint by putting small dots of hot glue on the back corners of the frame. the hot glue not only prevents movement, but it also holds the pictures away from the wall to prevent scratches and nicks.</p>

                <h2>Clean up paint in carpet</h2>
                <p>i used to think dropping a loaded paintbrush on the carpet meant replacing the carpet, until a former foreman told me this little tip. pour some denatured alchohol onto a rag and scrub away the paint. use a rag that is as close in color to the carpet, as the alcohol can transfer some of the rag's color to the carpet.</p>

                <h2>Remove highlighter stains</h2>
                <p>ever wish you could remove highlighter marks from a book? lemon juice fades highlighter enough to make it virtually undetectable.cut a lemon in half and get some lime juice on a cotton swab. run the swab over the highlighted text and watch the color fade.</p>

                <h2>Identify your keys at a glance</h2>
                <p>i have whole packet full of keys. to make it easier to quickly find my my most used keys,i paint both sides of the head with brightly colored nail polish. i use a different color for each key. the nail polish is extremly durable and you will be surprised how much longer it lasts than spray paint.</p>

                <h2>Get wrinkles out of your laundry with zero effort</h2>
                <p>throw a few ice cubes or a wet washcloths in the dryer with your wrinkled clothes. as the ice melt and the water turns to steam,it will remove the wrinkles.  this trick is not as effective with heavier clothing but is a miracle for lighter fabric. the best part is that you don't have to set the dryer for longer than 10 minutes for it to work.</p>

                <h2>Diy drip water</h2>
                <p>here is an easy way to turn any hose into a drip-watering hose.drill 1/8 in. holes every 2 in.and screw a cap the end. weave the hose around your plants and turn on the spigot.</p>
